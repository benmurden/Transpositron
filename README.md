A demo of Web Audio API and transposition.

This project uses Angular.js, Material Design, Gulp, SASS, and was generated with Yeoman.

## Usage
Multi-touch devices are fully supported with the displayed piano keyboard, but you can also use a mouse to click the keys. Notes in the selected scale are also mapped to your keyboard keys, so you can jam out that way, too.

## Contributing
Run locally by installing dependencies.
```
npm install
bower install
```

You may also need the Gulp CLI installed globally.

`npm install -g gulp-cli`

Then run the Gulp command.

`gulp serve`

### Testing

Run tests with the following command.

`gulp test`

or

`gulp test:auto`
