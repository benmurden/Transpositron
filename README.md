# Transpositron
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benmurden/Transpositron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmurden/Transpositron)

A demo of Web Audio API and transposition.

This project uses Angular.js, Material Design, Gulp, SASS, and was generated with Yeoman.

## Usage
Multi-touch devices are fully supported with the displayed piano keyboard, but you can also use a mouse to click the keys. Notes in the selected scale are also mapped to your keyboard keys, so you can jam out that way, too.

## Contributing
Run locally by installing dependencies.

`npm install`
`bower install`

Then run the Gulp command.

`gulp serve`
